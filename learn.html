            <u>Clubs & Societies</u>
            <p>
              At PU we believe that education goes far beyond classrooms and that extra-curricular activities play a major role in developing a student’s personality and future. Therefore students are encouraged to take the lead in creating their own clubs and societies in line with their interests. Beyond student-led initiatives Phoenicia University also hosts a wide range of events throughout the year to raise awareness of social and environmental issues that seek to engage minds and stimulate debate.

            <u>Abled Friendly Campus</u>
            <p>
              Phoenicia University firmly believes that no student should be excluded from participation in, or denied the benefits of, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination in, any university program or activity. In line with this, Phoenicia University is committed to ensuring that differently abled students have equal access to educational opportunities. The campus is designed with this in mind, enabling free and active participation in all facets of university life. Staff at PU are on hand to make sure that differently abled students receive appropriate support in their mobility around campus and their academic and social life. We believe that Phoenicia University’s commitment to diversity will set a leading example and enrich its own community and those beyond it.
